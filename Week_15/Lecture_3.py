# 1. Arrays-Max Value In Array
# Take an input N, the size of the array. Take N more inputs and store that in an array. Write a
# function which returns the maximum value in the array. Print the value returned.
# 1. It reads a number N.
# 2. Take Another N number as input and store it in an Array.
# 3. calculate the max value in the array and return that value.
# Input Format
# The first line contains integer n as the size of the array. Next n lines contain a single integer as
# an element of the array.
# Constraints
# N cannot be Negative. The range of Numbers can be between -1000000000 to 1000000000
# Output Format
# Print the required output.
# Sample Input
# 4
# 2
# 8
# 6
# 4
# Sample Output
# 8
# Explanation
# Arrays= {2, 8, 6, 4} => Max value = 8.



# 2. Reverse List
# Write a program to print a list L in reverse order without creating a new list.
# Input Format
# The first line contains space-separated list items of list L.
# Output Format
# Display a single-line output of the list in reverse.
# Sample Input
# 34 SAITM 45 CB &
# Sample Output
# ['&', 'CB', '45', 'SAITM', '34']



# 3. Odd and Even back in Delhi
# Due to an immense rise in Pollution, Kejriwal is back with the Odd and Even Rule in Delhi. The
# scheme is as follows, each car will be allowed to run on Sunday if the sum of digits which are
# even is divisible by 4 or the sum of digits which are odd in that number is divisible by 3.
# However, to check every car for the above criteria can't be done by the Delhi Police. You need
# to help Delhi Police by finding out if a car numbered N will be allowed to run on Sunday?
# Input Format
# The first line contains N , then N integers follow each denoting the number of the car.
# Constraints
# N<=1000 Car No >=0 && Car No <=1000000000
# Output Format
# N lines each denoting "Yes" or "No" depending upon whether that car will be allowed on Sunday
# or Not !
# Sample Input
# 2
# 12345
# 12134
# Sample Output
# Yes
# No
# Explanation
# 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 which is divisible by 3
# 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 which is NOT divisible by 3 and 2+4 = 6 which is not divisble by 4.



# 4. The Watermelon Split
# Pete and his friend Billy went to buy a watermelon on a hot summer day. After weighing the
# watermelon, which showed w kilos, they decided to divide it. However, they faced a problem
# because they both prefer even numbers and want each part to weigh an even number of kilos.
# The two parts do not have to be equal, but they must be positive. Can you help them find out if
# it's possible to divide the watermelon the way they want? They are exhausted and eager to start
# their meal as soon as possible.
# Input Format
# The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100000) — the weight of
# the watermelon bought by the boys.
# Constraints
# 1 ≤ w ≤ 100000
# Output Format
# Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even
# number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.
# Sample Input
# 8
# Sample Output
# YES
# Explanation
# The watermelon weighing 8 kgs can be split in any of the following ways:
# 1) Pete: 2, Billy: 6
# 2) Pete: 4, Billy: 4
# 3) Pete: 6, Billy: 2



# 5.Star Pattern
# Write a program to print given pattern by taking input N.
# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer N.
# Constraints
# Output Format
# Display the pattern as result.
# Sample Input
# 5
# Sample Output
