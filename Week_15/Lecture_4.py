# 6.R4 -- Pattern


# 6.Take as input N, a number. Print the pattern according to given input and output section.
# Input Format
# Integer
# Constraints
# 1 <= N <= 100;
# Output Format
# Pattern
# Sample Input
# 3
# Sample Output
# *
# **
# ***


# 7.Half Pyramid Pattern
# Write a program to print given pattern by taking input N.
# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer N.
# Constraints
# Output Format
# Display the pattern as result.
# Sample Input
# 5
# Sample Output
# 1
# 1 2
# 1 2 3
# 1 2 3 4
# 1 2 3 4 5


# 8. Unique Number - I
# We are given an array containg n numbers. All the numbers are present twice except for
# one number which is only present once. Find the unique number without taking any
# extra spaces and in linear time. ( Hint - Use Bitwise )
# Input Format
# First line contains the number n. Second line contains n space separated number.
# Constraints
# n < 10^5
# Output Format
# Output a single line containing the unique number
# Sample Input
# 7
# 1 1 2 2 3 3 4
# Sample Output
# 4
# Explanation
# 4 is present only once



# 9. Factorial
# Write a program which can compute the factorial of N.
# Warning : Test case 3 has a big input >900. So it might not work in your language.
# Input Format
# The first line contains a integer N
# Constraints
# 0<=N<1000
# Output Format
# Display a single line integer output of the factorial.
# Sample Input
# 7
# Sample Output
# 5040



# 10 .Natural Numbers
# Write a program to print all the natural numbers from 1 to N. Then print the same in
# reverse order.
# Input Format
# The first line contains a integer N.
# Constraints
# 0<N<1000
# Output Format
# Display space separated numbers from 1 to N in first line and in reverse order in the
# second line.
# Sample Input
# 10
# Sample Output
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
# 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
