# print the resultant string.
# Input:
# A = "**h*e*l*lo*"
# Output:

# Chaudhary Suyash
# 9.Reverse string
# Write a program to reverse the words present in a string. Check example input/output.
# Input:
# Everyone loves data science
# Output:
# enoyrevE sevol atad ecneics
# 10. tolower()
# The uppercase letters from A to Z are converted to lowercase letters from a to z respectively.
# Print the lowercase version of the given String.
# Input:
# A = PythoN
# Output:
# python
# 11.toupper()
# The lowercase letters from a to z is converted to uppercase letters from A to Z respectively.
# Print the uppercase version of the given the string.
# Input:
# A = pYthON
# Output:
# PYTHON
# 12.Isalnum()
# Print 1 if all the characters of a character array are alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, and 0-9) else, print 0.
# Input:
# A = Python45
# Output:
# 1
# 13.Isalpha()
# Print 1 if all the characters of the character array are alphabetical (a-z and A-Z), else print 0.
# Input:
# A = Python
# Output:
# 1
# 14.First Occurrence
# Y ou are given a character string A, having length N and an integer ASCII code B.
# Y ou have to tell the leftmost occurrence of the character having ASCII code equal to B, in A or
# report that it does not exist.
# Input:
# A = "aabbcc"
# B = 98
# Output:
# 2
# 15.First Occurrence Of Word
# Y ou are given two character strings A and B.
# Y ou have to find the first occurrence of string B in string A, as a substring, and return the starting
# position of first occurrence.
# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For e.g "at" is a substring in
# "catalogue".
# Input:
# A = "aabababaa"
# B = "ba"
# Output:
# 2
# 16.Count Occurrences
# Find the number of occurrences of bob in string A consisting of lowercase English alphabets.
# Input:
# "abobc"
# Output:
# 1
# Input:
# "bobob"
# Output:
# 2
# 17.String operations
# Akash likes playing with strings. One day he thought of applying following operations on the
# string in the given order:
# Concatenate the string with itself.
# Delete all the uppercase letters.
# Replace each vowel with '#'.
# Y ou are given a string A of size N consisting of lowercase and uppercase alphabets. Return the
# resultant string after applying the above operations.
# NOTE: 'a' , 'e' , 'i' , 'o' , 'u' are defined as vowels.
# Input:
# A="aeiOUz"
# Output:
# "###z###z"
