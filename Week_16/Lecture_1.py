# 11. Is Palindrome?
# Take as input N, a number. Take N more inputs and store that in an array. Write a
# recursive function that tests if the array is a palindrome and returns a Boolean value.
# Print the value returned.
# Input Format
# Enter a number N , add N more numbers
# Constraints
# None
# Output Format
# Display the Boolean result
# Sample Input
# 4
# 1
# 2
# 2
# 1
# Sample Output
# true
# 12. Check Palindrome
# Write a program to find if a given string S is a palindrome or not. If palindrome print
# "Palindrome" otherwise print "Not a palindrome"
# .
# Input Format
# The first line contains a string S.
# Constraints
# Output Format
# Display a single line output showing the result.
# Sample Input
# racecar
# Sample Output
# Palindrome
# 13.Arrays-Linear Search
# Problem Preview
# Take as input N, the size of an array. Take N more inputs and store that in an array. Take
# another number’s input as M. Write a function which returns the index on which M is
# found in an array, in case M is not found -1 is returned. Print the value returned.
# 1. It reads a number N.
# 2.Take Another N numbers as an input and store them in an Array.
# 2. Take another number M as an input.
# 3. If M is found in the Array the index of M is returned else -1 is returned and print
# the value returned.
# Input Format
# Constraints
# N cannot be Negative. Range of Numbers can be between -1000000000 to
# 1000000000. M can be between -1000000000 to 1000000000.
# Output Format
# Sample Input
# 5
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 9
# 17
# 17
# Sample Output
# 4
# Explanation
# Given array = {2, 4, 6, 9, 17}. Target number = 17. Index = 4.
# 14. Exceptionally odd
# Problem Preview
# Given an array of N integers where all numbers occur an even number of times except
# one number which occurs an odd number of times. Find that number.
# Input Format
# First line of the input contains integer n, denoting the size of the array. Next line of the
# input contains n space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.
# Constraints
# 1<=n<=1000
# Output Format
# Print that number which occurs an odd number of times.
# Sample Input
# 7
# 5 7 2 7 5 2 5
# Sample Output
# 5
# 15. Arrays-Target Sum Pairs
# Take as input N, the size of array. Take N more inputs and store that in an array. Take as
# input “target”, a number. Write a function which prints all pairs of numbers which sum to
# target.
# Input Format
# The first line contains input N. Next N lines contains the elements of array and (N+1)th
# line contains target number.
# Constraints
# Length of the arrays should be between 1 and 1000.
# Output Format
# Print all the pairs of numbers which sum to target. Print each pair in increasing order.
# Sample Input
# 5
# 1
# 3
# 4
# 2
# 5
# 5
# Sample Output
# 1 and 4
# 2 and 3
# Explanation
# them.
# Find any pair of elements in the array which has sum equal to target element and print
# 16.Reverse String
# You are given a string 's'
# . You have to reverse this string.
# Input Format
# A string 's'
# .
# Constraints
# 1 <= s.length() <= 10^5
# s[i] is a printable ascii character.
# Output Format
# A string, that is the reverse of 's'
# .
# Sample Input
# hello
# Sample Output
# olleh
# Explanation
# "olleh" is reverse of "hello".
# 17.Maximum Subarray Sum
# PreviousNex
# Given an array and you need to find out the contiguous subarray that has the largest sum and
# return the sum of the subarray.
# Input Format
# A number representing n length of array. N lines representing the n elements of the array. The
# last line takes A number representing the target sum.
# Constraints
# The length of the array must be less than 10000
# Output Format
# Print the sum of the maximum subarray
# Sample Input
# 9
# -2
# 1
# -3
# 4
# -1
# 2
# 1
# -5
# 4
# Sample Output
# 6
# Explanation
# {-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4}
# The resultant will be 6.
# {4,-1,2,1}is the subarray that has the largest sum = 6.
# 18 .Count Digits
# Take the following as input.
# A number
# A digit
# value returned.
# Write a function that returns the number of times digit is found in the number. Print the
# Input Format
# Integer (A number) Integer (A digit)
# Constraints
# 0 <= N <= 1000000000 0 <= Digit <= 9
# Output Format
# Integer (count of times digit occurs in the number)
# Sample Input
# 5433231
# 3
# Sample Output
# 3
# Explanation
# The digit can be from 0 to 9. Assume decimal numbers.In the given case digit 3 is
# occurring 3 times in the given number.
# 19.Fibonacci Number
# The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci
# sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
# That is,
# F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
# F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
# Given n, calculate Fib(n).
# Write a solution with complexity O(n)
